  Source code changes in this project:
    Support manual fragmentation of large scans on output to support
        use with NICs that cannot reassemble well
    Replaced busy loop on ad9510 programming with semaphore.
      Now should consider making the sem_wait() be timed to prevent
        lockup
    Removed yield() from udpThread after lowering priority
    Updated verbosity to display network configuration. Also
        eliminated some less useful messages.
    Parametrized MAC Address and IP Address in terms of SSP_BOARD_ID,
      which can be specified in build config.
    Removed definition of SSP_PROTO_A from headers for better
      compatability: Now define it in build config
  
  Source code changes in LwIP:
    Added semaphore implementation for receive queue processing in
      xemacliteif.c
    Removed yield() from xadapater.c
  
  Configuration Changes:
    Adjusted priorities of all threads
      added -DTCPIP_THREAD_PRIO=2 to build config
      defined main_main priority as 4 in SW Platform Settings
        (must be greater than TCPIP_THREAD_PRIO)
    Include other build options in build config
      SSP_BOARD_ID
      SSP_PROTO_A
    Remove yield() from xilkernel config
    Increased number of threads to 16 (probably overkill)
      Need a minimum of 5 (probably plus one for idle?) then an
      additional thread for each TCP connection. If they are
      cleaned up efficiently, that's great, but I don't want
      to lose communications because I've run out of threads.
    Reduced thread stack size from 8000 to 6000 without any
      apparent problems.
