N_ISBITS: The number of I2C buses leaving the FPGA
N_PTRH: The number of PTRH subsystems attached
N_ESWITCH: The number of external switch devices plus the
    number of I2C buses that have PTRHs attached directly.
    This will typically be equal to N_ISBITS, but not
    if there are multiple switches connected to one bus.
ESID: An array of N_PTRH elements in the range N_ESWITCH-1 downto 0
    Identifies which external switch or bus a particular
    PTRH is attached to
ISwitchBit: An array of N_ESWITCH elements in the range N_ISBITS-1 downto 0
    Identifies which I2C bus the PTRH or external switch is connected to
ESwitchAddr: An array of N_ESWITCH 7-bit I2C addresses
    If this ESID identifies an external switch, this address will be
    non-zero. If it is zero, it identifies a directly-connected PTRH.
ESwitchBit: An array of N_PTRH elements in the range 7 downto 0
    Identifies which bit on the external switch this PTRH is
    connected to. The setting is ignored if no external switch
    is involved.
