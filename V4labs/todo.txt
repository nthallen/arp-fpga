Interrupt debugging:

TmrCtr connected directly to microblaze
ISR XTmrCtr_InterruptHandler defined as ISR in XPS SPS Interrupt Handlers
I have verified that vectors are appropriate for calling the top level
__interrupt_handler() (standalone_v1_00_a/src/microblaze_interrupt_handler.c)
and the MB_InterruptVectorTable[] defined in
(standalone_v1_00_a/src/microblaze_interrupts_g.c) correctly points to
XTmrCtr_InterruptHandler

I call XTmrCtr_SetHandler(&XTC, TimerCounterHandler, &XTC);

to define my handler, but my handler never gets called.

For test, I called

microblaze_register_handler( (XInterruptHandler)TimerCounterHandler,
      &XTC );

i.e. I replaced the TmrCtr interrupt handler with my own, and then
I can see that the code in my handler gets executed when the
interrupt occurs, but I still lose control of the processor afterward.
